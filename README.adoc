= Couchbase Antora Preview

https://travis-ci.org/spjmurray/couchbase-antora-preview[image:https://travis-ci.org/spjmurray/couchbase-antora-preview.png[]]

Simple container which automates the installation of Antora, compilation of Couchbase
documentation for a single repository and display via a web server.

== Quick Start

A typical execution of the container will look like the following, the container image is in docker hub so will just work without having to build the container manually:

[source,console]
----
docker run --rm -ti \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  --mount type=bind,source=/home/simon/go/src/github.com/couchbase/couchbase-operator,target=/src,readonly \
  spjmurray/couchbase-antora-preview:1.1.0 \
  --repo url=/src,branches=master:1.0.x,start_path=docs/user
----

=== Container Arguments

--rm::
Removes the container once execution has terminated.

-ti::
Allocate a pseudo terminal and allow input.  This field is required to provide an interactive session.

--publish 8080:80::
Bind unprivileged port 8080 on the host system to port 80 on the container.  By default the static content will be generated with this port.  If you wish to use a different host port please specify the `--port` argument to the container entry point.  This argument is required to expose the HTTP service.

--mount type=bind,source=/home/simon/go/src/github.com/couchbase/couchbase-operator,target=/src,readonly::
Mounts your AsciiDoc repository in the container.  This must be a Git repository containing at least one Antora module.  Mounts can be placed where you like and may be refered to by the `--repo` argument of the container.

spjmurray/couchbase-antora-preview:1.1.0::
This is the name of the container image to use.  Pre-built images are avaialble on https://hub.docker.com/r/spjmurray/couchbase-antora-preview/[Docker Hub].

--port 8080::
The host port mapping to the container web server.  This argument is optional and defaults to 8080.

--repo url=/src,branches=master:1.0.x,start_path=docs/user::
This argument is passed to the container entry point.  This specifies a repository to be added to the Antora playbook.  The `url` parameter is required and specifies the path to a mounted git repository or a reference to github.  The `branches` parameter is optional and specifies which branches to use for document generation.  The `start_path` parameter is used to select the path within the repository to find the `antora.yml` module configuration.  For further details please consult the https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.1/playbook/configure-content-sources/[Antora documentation].

NOTE: The container runs in an interactive shell, to stop execution simply press `Ctl+C`
